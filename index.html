       1. This is the element we'll render our Ractive to.

       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'
  -->
  <script id='template' type='text/ractive'>
    <p>Number is {{number}}</p>
    <button id="increment">Increment</button>
  </script>

       3. You can always get the most recent stable version from the URL below.
       If you want the newest features, use the 'edge' version instead:

           http://cdn.ractivejs.org/edge/ractive.min.js

       If you need IE8 support, change 'ractive' to 'ractive-legacy'.
  -->
  <script src='ractive.min.js'></script>

  <!--
       4. We've got an element in the DOM, we've created a template, and we've
       loaded the library - now it's time to build our Hello World app.
